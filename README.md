# Events_adults

##Events 1v1
The initial experiment of the Events study.

##Events 1v2
Another version of the first Events experiment. The parameters were changed.

##Events 2
An experiment testing "moved" instead of jumped. The background is different, but the movements are the same

##Events 3
Similar to Events 2, but the sine curve that had contributed a sense of "jumping" is removed. There is one version with pauses, and one version without pauses.
